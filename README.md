# PrivacyEnforcerPS
Semi-useful powershell script that allows blocking of IPs, cleaning logs etc.


This script was mainly made for "Shell" learning.
Use it as you wish, I just don't have the time to do anything with it really.

For proper startup (dependencies auto-installation) run the script using the loader.bat

>Enjoy
